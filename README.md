   ## brief
   This is my Master final project based on Android for memory loss. It has some functionalities which fully implemented such as chat,contacts, take pictures, take videos, record audios, record texts..etc. It also has upload and download functionality...etc.

 App fully works and need to upgrade the SDK version to Google newest version if necessarily.
 
 ## features
 **Fingerprint authentication**
 **Symbolic UI design**
 **Local Database:SQLite**
 **Multiple frameworks** 
 
 ## User requirement
   
   I have been approached by Mr Annouymos, a Psychotherapist who deals with refugees, and other displaced people wants help with the creation of a mobile phone App which will be used together with a training programme and support workers to help traumatised people recover memories and hopefully be able to move forward in their lives. A feature of people who are traumatised is that they often remember little of their past and seem stuck in the present unable to move forward.

The app will be a therapeutic tool for capturing and browsing material about a person's life history. This will involve a navigable timeline, represented by a helix, on which episodes in the person's life can be identified and associated with various media. The media may be video, photographs, text, speech, music etc.
